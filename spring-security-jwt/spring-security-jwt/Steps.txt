1. An /authenticate api endpoint--> It will accept userid and password and returns JWT as response.

http://localhost:8080/authenticate

{
 "username":"admin",
 "password":"password"
}

2. Implement the validation of jwt and validate the jwt token

http://localhost:8080/hello

Send with Authorization Type BearerToken and copy/paste the jwt token generated in the last step.
